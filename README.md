### Factory Design Pattern

- creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass
- also known as **virtual constructor**

#### Advantages 

- allows subclasses to choose the type of objects that will be created.
- promotes **loose-coupling** by eliminating the need to bing application-specific class into the code

#### Uses 

- when a class is unaware of the type of subclass it has to create
- when a class wants to give the control of creating its objects to it's subclass
